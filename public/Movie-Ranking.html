<h1>The Best Movies According to Brandon</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>The Other Guys</h3>
<p>
    This is one of the funniest movies I have ever watched. <br /> 
    The combination of Will Ferrel and Mark Whalberg is something special. <br />
    Most movies similar to this try too hard to be funny, whereas this movie just <br/>
    does a great job of being serious when it needs too and dropping jokes at the right time. 
</p>

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>
    The most iconic Batman movie ever made, starring Christian Bale as Batman, <br/>
    and Heath Ledger's legendary showcase of the Clown Prince of Crime Joker. <br/>
    As an avid Batman comic reader, this movie was so surreal and just one of those <br/>
    movies that I can watch on replay any day of the week.

<h3>Pokemon The First Movie: MewTwo Strikes Back</h3>
<p>
    This is a bit of an odd one but it's memorable to me as I remember seeing it <br/>
    in theatres as a kid and it was one of the first movies to ever make me cry. <br>
    I grew up on the game and the show, and could probably recite alot of lines from this <br>
    so I had to include it on the list.
